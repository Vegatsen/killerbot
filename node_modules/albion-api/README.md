# Albion API

A basic API implementation for Albion online using the limited gameinfo API.

Using the [Killboard](https://albiononline.com/en/killboard) page as reference i've gone through the calls made and have been adding them here for use in another project.
I decided to share as i thought others might also be able to make use of the API to build some tools.
